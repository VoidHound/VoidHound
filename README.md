- 👋 Hi, I’m @VoidHound (aka Sydney)
- 👀 I’m interested in all sorts of programming (web development, game development, app development, embedded systems, machine learning)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development (I know some front end already but am learning back end now)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that falls into my interests.
